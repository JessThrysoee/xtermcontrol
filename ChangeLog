   * Version 3.0

   * all: Major version bump because the strategy of when a configuration
	file is read has changed. Now xtermcontrol only reads the ~/.xtermcontrol file
	if run without options, or if specifically requested by the --file option.
	See also https://github.com/JessThrysoee/xtermcontrol/issues/1

   * src/configuration.c: Prevent the terminal from becomming unresponsive
	when attempting to report the current setting of a unsupported or
	disallowed property.

   * Version 2.11

   * src/xtermcontrol.c: Add basic tmux support. Contributed by turlutux.

2009-10-16  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.10

   * doc/xtermcontrol.roff: Update troubleshooting section. Add list
	of which xtermcontrol options are effected by which of the three
	xterm resources allowWindowOps, allowTitleOps, and allowFontOps.
	All of these resorces can be changed in the xterm ctrl+rightclick
	menu, or persistently in ~/.Xdefaults, to avoid xtermcontrol hangs.

   * all: remove compile warnings.

2007-09-03  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.9

   * doc/xtermcontrol.roff: Add note that xterm resource allowWindowOps
	should be set true, to allow xtermcontrol to use extended window
	control sequences, and avoid that it hangs.

2006-02-04  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.8

   * src/configuration.c: Fix regexp, so the '#rrggbb' way to specify a
	color works in configuration file. Reported by Olle Mulmo.

   * doc/xtermcontrol.roff: add BUGS section describing how install needs
	to setuid root on some broken systems.

2004-12-22  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.7

   * configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: remove all dependencies on Xlib.
	Reported by Rich Paul.

2004-10-11  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.6

   * src/xtermcontrol.c: rewrite of --get-* methods. On Cygwin chars are simply
   read (VMIN=)1 at a time.

   *config.guess, config.sub: removed. No need for specific Cygwin test.

   * all: remove --get-raw option. 

2004-10-03  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.5

   * configure.ac: update autotool scripts.

   * all: remove --timeout option. Use VMIN=1 && VTIME=1, this blocks until at
   least one char is available and makes --get-* much faster.
   
   Cygwin does not seem to get this right, as it reads only one char before
   blocking again, i.e. it uses VMIN as the maximum of chars to read in raw
   mode. The workaround is to set VMIN=0 and read nonblocking after a fixed
   timeout. Patch by Mark Paulus.

   * Version 2.4

   * doc/xtermcontrol.roff, src/xtermcontrol.h, doc/xtermcontrol.roff: Added
   new option: --timeout

   * doc/ctlseqs.ms, doc/ctlseqs.txt: updated from xterm-186

2004-01-07  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.3

   * src/xtermcontrol.h: don't include X11/Xlib.h, it not needed.

   * doc/xtermcontrol.roff, src/xtermcontrol.c, src/configuration.c,
   src/xtermcontrol.h, src/configuration.h: Update Copyright year. 

   * doc/xtermcontrol.roff: update documentation of the --font option with the
   syntax of how to access the fontmenu.

   NOTE: The implementation of the negative relative size fontmenu navigation
   at xterm patch level #184 has a typo preventing it from working correctly.
   This has been reported to the xterm maintainer.

2003-09-07  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.2

   * src/configuration.c, src/xtermcontrol.c: compile without errors and
   warnings with g++

2003-08-17  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.1 (only one minor version number is needed)

   * geometry.c: Source file removed. As of xterm patch #168 the window
   position bug has been fixed, so the Xlib workaround is no longer needed.

   * all: Added new options: --[get-]colorN
                             --[get-]highlight
                             --force
                             --reset
                             --get-raw

   NOTE: Setting highlight does not work at xterm patch level #179. A patch
   for this has been accepted by the xterm maintainer, so presumably, it
   should be fixed in the next release, i.e. #180.

2002-10-26  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.0.2

   * src/configuration.c: Problem: configuration files take no effect.
   Solution: remove newline from fgets input when reading key/value pairs
   from configuration file.

   * src/xtermcontrol.c: remove trailing whitespace from configuration file


2002-10-20  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.0.1

   * src/configuration.c: included OpenPKG.org patch.

   * configure.in: exit configure when X libs/includes not located

   * doc/xtermcontrol.spec: added rpm spec file.

2002-09-19  Jess Thrysoee

   * Version 2.0.0

   * all: Complete rewrite. Rename project from xtermcolors
   to xtermcontrol.

2002-05-18  Jess Thrysoee
